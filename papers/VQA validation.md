### A reinforcement learning approach for VQA validation: an application to diabetic macular edema grading



#### Overview:

This paper addresses the need for better validation methods for highly advanced Visual Question Answering (VQA) algorithms, particularly in the context of medical image analysis, focusing on diabetic macular edema (DME) grading. The authors propose an automatic adaptive questioning approach called Visual Turing Test (VTT) to evaluate the reasoning behavior of VQA algorithms. They introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that observes previous questions and selects the next question to pose, simulating the behavior of a clinician. Through experiments, they demonstrate that this approach generates question streams similar to those of a clinician, effectively evaluating the VQA method's performance. The paper suggests the use of beta distributions to characterize the performance of the VQA system as perceived by the interrogator. The results show that the proposed method can distinguish between reasonable and unreasonable responders, even if their average performance is similar. The authors propose future directions, including applying the framework to other clinical applications, generating more VQA datasets in collaboration with clinicians, and enhancing the representation of images in the questioning process. They also suggest exploring open-ended questions, introducing noise in the state or question, exploiting logical inconsistencies in responses, and integrating the questioning strategy into the training of the VQA model for improved interpretability.
